					<p style="color: #FFF; font-size: 20px; font-family: agency fb, arial"> Hell, Michigan was originally first settled in 1838 by a man named George Reeves. This town found its beginnings as a grist mill and general store on the edge of what is now referred to as Hell Creek. The town got its unusual name because Reeves had the habit of paying local farmers for their grain with his home distilled whiskey which led many of the wives of the farmers to remark that their husbands had “Gone to Hell again” when they were asked where their husbands were. In 1841, When Reeves was asked what he was going to name his town he said “Call it Hell for all I care, everybody else does!” The name caught on and “Hell” became the official town name.
